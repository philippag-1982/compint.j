[ ] report perf numbers in README
[ ] document these perf tricks:
    - deprecated String byte[] methods
    - trailing zeroes form
    - trailing zeroes form for fromScientific
    - mutability in general (inPlace methods) 
[ ] If IntAscii is useful, it lacks the test code quality of Int9
[ ] If IntAscii is useful, it lacks functionality of Int9 (like primitive overloads)
[ ] Port more of "perf" package to JMH
[ ] Implement Int9::divide(Int9, Int9)
[ ] proper implementation of Int9::pow
